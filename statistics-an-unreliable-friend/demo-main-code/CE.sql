--Addition AFTER Sql Saturday Oslo, just as comment, will create demos to "prove" this odd behaviour
--Now where did THAT estimate come from?
--It _seems_ like the logic is this:
--The lesser values of:
--Density*TotalRowcount and SQRT(TotalRowcount)
--Density*TotalRowcount is about 12500 rows
--
--SQRT(TotalRowcount) is about 1700 rows, so that value is chosen
